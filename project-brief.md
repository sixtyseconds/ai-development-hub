Development Brief: Centralized AI Application Project Management Platform

Project Overview:

Develop a centralized project management application to manage AI projects, client feature requests, project requirements, and support tickets. The tool should allow internal teams to access a consolidated view of all client projects, while clients interact through personalized, branded installations on their websites.

Key Objectives:

Centralize all project data (features, requirements, support queries).

Allow client-specific customizations to match branding and website themes.

Enable seamless integration onto client websites for direct feature requests and ticketing.

Provide internal team with a single unified dashboard to manage multiple clients simultaneously.

Core Functionalities:

Internal Team Portal:

Dashboard: Overview of all active client projects, feature requests, support tickets, and statuses.

Project Roadmaps: View and manage individual client roadmaps.

Client Management: Add, remove, and configure new client installations.

Ticketing System: Respond to, prioritize, and close client support queries.

Feature Request Management: Review, prioritize, approve, or reject new feature requests.

Reporting & Analytics: Generate insights into common feature requests, recurring support issues, and project timelines.

Client-Side Installation:

Branded Integration: Easy-to-install widget or embed code that matches the client's brand and website theme.

Feature Request Form: Clients can submit new feature requests directly.

Support Query System: Clients can raise support tickets, track their status, and communicate with the support team.

Roadmap Visibility: Optional public or private view of their project roadmap and statuses.

Technical Requirements:

Architecture: Cloud-based, scalable backend (preferably Supabase or similar) with robust API endpoints.

Frontend Customization: Tailwind CSS for rapid, theme-able customization.

Authentication: Secure multi-user login system for internal team; client-side installations require minimal or no authentication.

API Integration: REST API or GraphQL for client website integration.

Security: Secure handling of sensitive client data, GDPR compliance.

User Roles & Permissions:

Admin: Full access to all features, client configurations, and user management.

Internal Team Member: Access to assigned projects, manage tickets, and feature requests.

Client User: Limited access through their website interface; can submit requests and view roadmap/ticket statuses.

Integration Points:

Simple JavaScript embed or iframe for client websites.

Webhooks and API endpoints for advanced client integrations (Make.com, Zapier, etc.).

Deliverables:

Fully functional backend system with documented API.

Internal management portal (web-based).

Embeddable client widget/component.

Detailed setup and customization guide.

Initial deployment to a secure, scalable cloud environment.
